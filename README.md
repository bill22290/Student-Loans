# Student-Loans

For this project I will be trying to predict a college cohert's overall default rate on student loans based upon feature variables in a dataset.   Data is already collected on the U.S. Department of Education Federal Student Aid website. 

The dataset to be used for this project can be found here:

-Some of the variables include school name, length of the longest program offered by the institution, school type, number of borrowers in default, number of borrowers in repayment, institution default rate, congressional district and institutionâ€™s department of education regional code.
